### Footnotes

#### Coding standards

- You can use scripts `run-linter.sh` and `check-docstyle.sh` to check if the code follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) coding standards. These scripts can be run w/o any arguments:

```
./run-linter.sh
./check-docstyle.sh
```

The first script checks the indentation, line lengths, variable names, whitespace around operators etc. The second
script checks all documentation strings - its presense and format. Please fix any warnings and errors reported by these
scripts.

#### Code complexity measurement

The scripts `measure-cyclomatic-complexity.sh` and `measure-maintainability-index.sh` are used to measure code complexity. These scripts can be run w/o any arguments:

```
./measure-cyclomatic-complexity.sh
./measure-maintainability-index.sh
```

The first script measures cyclomatic complexity of all Python sources found in the repository. Please see [this table](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commandline.html#the-cc-command) for further explanation how to comprehend the results.

The second script measures maintainability index of all Python sources found in the repository. Please see [the following link](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commandline.html#the-mi-command) with explanation of this measurement.
